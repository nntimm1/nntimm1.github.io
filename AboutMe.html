            <p class="bodyText"> <br> I currently live in Brew City, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I
                enjoy working with data and molding it into a story to 
                tell others. I have a strong background in oral and written communication, 
                providing complicated information in understandable formats. I have developed and 
                designed tools used in the management decision-making process, helping to drive 
                business forward. In my spare time i enjoy watching my loacl professional sports teams, 
                spending time outdoors, and solving puzzles jigsaws specifically. <br> <br>
            
                I have studied at UW Milwaukee receiving certification in Data Analysis. I am currently 
                attending devCodeCamp in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with the hopes of becoming 
                a Fullstack Developer. Working with C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ASP.NET. </p>

                the ability to navigate an ever changing landscape of rules and technology, 
                the fortitude to defend your logic while being flexible enough to bend to the 
                client's needs, the insight to recognize when the data looks off, and the ingenuity 
                to find solutions to problems that aren't always straight forward. Nicolas Timm 
                exhibited all these skills and all with a smile on his face. He was willing to help 
                anywhere and in any way we needed. He has been a joy to work with!"" </p><br>
